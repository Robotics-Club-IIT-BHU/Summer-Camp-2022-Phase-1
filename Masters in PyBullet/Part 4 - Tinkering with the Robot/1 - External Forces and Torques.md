## External Force and Torque:
_Q.Why do we really need to simulate a external force on the robot ??_

_Ans: To kick robots and bully them and have fun !! why,else ?:-)_

Well on a serious note, one of the key challenge to overcome in transfering a robot from simulation to reality is the undezireable and unpredictable disturbance caused in the real world.The source of these disturbances that hinders the motion of our robot is generally a force or torque.Thus, as robotic professionals it is important that we make robot controllers that are **robust,agile and versatile**.So, we should learn to simulate such undezirable conditions in our simulations aswell.

The function(s) that enables you to design such forces are designed below:
