# Task for the Part
- For this part, you need to spawn a sphere at some height at x=0, y=0.
- There should be a camera attached to the sphere, such that it points in y direction always.
- The camera should move with the sphere when the sphere falls.
- Also, spawn a cube along the y axis as shown in the video.
- When the sphere reaches at around 0.5 height, respawn the sphere at its current location and set the gravity to 0, so that the sphere stops there.
- Now, on pressing the key 'q', the text "Hurray!!" should be visible on the cube (in the simulation window).

**Note: You can play with the gravity's magnitude and can set it to any value, not necessarily -10.**

  <i>You can have a look at the sample video by clicking above. Since the video is a bit large, please download it first. After every timestep, I am displaying the camera feed using cv2.imshow function. Left is the simulation window and on the right is the rendered image using cv2 function.</i>
