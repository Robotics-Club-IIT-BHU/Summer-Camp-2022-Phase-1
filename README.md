# Robotics Summer Camp 2022
#### Hello all! Done with your midsems? It's time to learn something cool in these hot summers ðŸ¥µ
#### The Robotics Club IIT BHU brings you a summer camp where you can learn various robotics concepts in two Phases. Phase 1 will be basics of Robotics and PyBullet, a beginner-friendly simulator and Phase 2 will include specialization in various tracks of robotics. The repository will provide you a headstart for various topics, and a lot of resources will also be there. The ultimate goal is to make you familiar with the basic concepts of Robotics.

## Phase-I
#### In phase 1, we will first introduce the basic architecture of a robot i.e., Universal Robot Structure. Then we'll cover some maths, some physics required to understand the functioning of a robot or any dynamical system in general.

</p>

#### Next comes the "Masters in PyBullet" section, where you will get familiar with a simulator called as PyBullet. We will understand the need of a simulator and will go through some of the cool features of PyBullet such as controlling and playing with the robots or creating some simulations of your JEE physics fantasy :)

#### We expect you to go through the content one by one, if you are stuck somewhere, google it, or else you can reach out to us. Complete the tasks at the end of each part and try to submit before the deadline :)

</p>

#### Feel this is going one way?? Don't worry, you can put up queries on the discord server, or do general chit-chat there. Your seniors (i.e., us ðŸ˜Œ) will be available there. Discussing with peers, how they are progressing, also helps to do the task. The server surely does the job.

#### We recommend you to use Linux Operating System throughout the camp. You can Dual Boot you PC with Ubuntu 20.04.
