# Orientation
To define a robot's configuration, another important thing you need to understand is the orientation. In real world scenarios, multiple GPS and compass sensors are used to measure current position and orientation in space. The goal is to define rotations with respect to the object's local frame. There are a few ways to determine the orientation and rotations of objects in 3D space:
- Axis angles
- Euler angles
- Quaternions

This video ðŸ‘‡gives great intuition about what Euler angles actually are:<br>

But there is a problem with Euler angles, referred to as Gimbal Lock, most commonly heard in the movie Apollo 13. Check out this video:<br>

Sometimes, the actual definition of Euler angles and the definition while defining Gimbal Lock can be confusing.<br>

Before moving to the next part, make sure to clarify everything about Euler angles. Clean your mind, relax, because the next way to determine rotations is...is...is...

  <h1 align="center">Quaternionsss!!!</h1>

Quaternions make use of imaginary numbers, yes you heard that right. But the idea behind them turns out to be really beautiful, although not so elegant. Now, if you want me to explain quaternions, be ready to be disappointed, cuzzz....

  And...I don't think Quaternions can be explained any better than in this animation by 3 Blue 1 Brown:
